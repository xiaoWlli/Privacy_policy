# Privacy Policy
  When you start using the app, you have agreed to this privacy policy.  
  Now the app data won't be stored in the cloud, that is, I won't collect any of your private data. Other features require access to your photo album and use of the camera. These features are also local, so you don't have to worry about your data leaking.  
  Thank you very much for your use.
